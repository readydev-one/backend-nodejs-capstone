**As a** developer,

**I need** to finish writing and finalizing all relevant frontend user stories,

**So that** I can clearly define the backend service requirements and begin implementation effectively.


Acceptance Criteria:

All frontend user stories are documented and approved.

Each user story includes expected UI behavior and data needs.

APIs and data structures required by the frontend are identified.

User stories are prioritized and grouped logically (e.g., authentication, dashboard, etc.).

A list of backend endpoints needed is generated from the frontend requirements.
